in this video we're going to look at pvsaul premium . if you saw premium it helps you to simulate the pv system so that you can determine if it fulfills the customer's requirements looking at the main page you'll see a number of icons on top each icon represents a step in the simulation process the first step is where you enter your project data project data will end up on the report you can enter customer details contact persons address details images etc etc so for now i've just entered the customer's address moving to the next app you can either click on that little arrow on the left hand or you can click on the actual icon the next icon is where we set up the system type climate and the grid the top left is where you set up the type of system from the dropbox you can select a number of different system types starting off with a simple grip connected tv system with no loads or ac export system also known as then a grid connected system with some loads systems with battery backup and electrical appliances as well etcetera for now we're going to select the cryptic system with loads bottom left is where you set up your climate data this is very important as pv saw will use the climate data to simulate the pv system so here we've selected south africa and we've selected our location where the pv system is going to be if the system is not the location is not already in the drop down box you can add a location by clicking on the little globe to the right or right side of the drop down box and select from a map where the system will be installed to the right you set up the ac mains in this case it's a single phase 230 volt system that we're looking at the next step is to specify the consumption information let's go to the next icon consumption here you can enter consumption information in a couple of different ways if you go to add consumption you'll see it is load profiles or individual appliances monthly annual consumption of surplus consumption so let's start with load profiles in the load profiles there's a number of predefined load so it's already in a system that one can use you can also add load profiles from day profiles day profiles how that works is each hour of the day is represented by a certain percentage so let's say between 10 and 11 we use four percent or 10 and 11 we use 5. 47 of our daily consumption so you can specify per hour what percentage of the daily consumption is used you can even go further and specify it for winter weekdays winter saturdays winter sunday spring weekdays sundays saturdays etc so you can very finely define your low profile over here can be quite a tedious task then you can also specify individual appliances here you can for instance specify in this case a computer and you can specify when the computer is on what what hour of the day what day of the week and then even what day of the year and then you also need to specify the power of the computer so this is even more tedious because you will need to specify for each and every component or appliance that you use probably the best way is to add a load profile from measured values and yeah you can actually import a load profile from a logger that you've installed over a period of time now in this case i'm just going to import a simple file so in this case i've got hourly value so my interval is 16 minutes 365 days um my unit is kilowatt and the format of the data and then if i if i um okay then the data is imported and then i've got my load profile in theta system so this is probably the easiest and more accurate way of adding a load profile [Music] the next step is to enter our building information here we go to the 3d design step if you go to edit you'll see that pbsol offers you a couple of different options some of the options are map section a max map shape sim can be a overhead plan of your roof plan of your building it can be a drone image it can be a google earth image etc anything that you import from externally first need to be scaled in pv saw another option is an imported 3d model normally supplied by your architect of the building that's a very good and accurate way of entering a building you can enter simple roof areas more complex buildings and so forth so for now i'm going to enter a building with a cable roof and i click on start so yes there's our building on the right hand side you'll see the orientation itself on the top side norfolk beading at the bottom side so this building can be edited so let's say we want to make it a bit bigger 15 meter wide or the roof and the building itself i can also take this building i can copy it now i've got two buildings so let's say this one i want to orientate a bit differently once again i can edit it and i'll make that one 90 degrees um so what you can also do is now to integrate the two buildings together you've got something like that now if you look at the building we've got volume like that if you hover your mouse over the roof areas or any area it will see it will highlight so you can now use these highlighted areas to enter to add your pv modules and so forth so let's let's go and add some modules to let's say for instance this roof i've activated this roof the next step from the menu there is module coverage so here i can select from a database of modules on the left hand side is a manufacturer so there's a whole list of modules i'm just going to randomly randomly select a manufacturer.js solar and let's say we're going to use a 285 watt model you can specify vertical or horizontal as well okay so now the option would be to add the module so you can add the individual module to your roof the moment the model becomes green you can actually add it to the roof but you can also do other things if you go back to the object view you can enter a area around the building around the roof we don't want to install so let's say we want to keep open about 300 millimeters or 400 millimeters around the roof so now you will not be able to install a tv module in that wired area going back to module coverage another way is to fill an area you specify the horizontal and vertical distance between modules normally that will be your clamp size and then you can use your mouse and you can drag the number of modules onto your roof so in this case we're going to put about five kilowatt on you can also move it around a little bit you can do a shading analysis by clicking on the shade frequency there so yeah pbso will do a shading analysis over one full year and it will per module indicate any shading that you might have so here you can see that this little this one module will have a little bit of shading um every year so what one can do and to alleviate a little bit is to move your muscles to a place where it's a bit better obviously if you have trees or other buildings your shading might be much more severe and there you might need to look at other options to eliminate excessive shading once the modules are on we can move on to the next step which is module configuration this is basically where you select the inverter so i'm going to select my inverter in this case um i'm going to add a new inverter and i want to add one inverter and then once again i'm going to select from a database i'm going to use the inverter and i'm going to use about a 4 kilowatt sma beta so this inverter's got two mpp trackers and we can now specify how many modules the tracker now you can see we've got 18 modules so we can have one string of nine modules maybe if you click on this button it will give you the limit so one string up to 13 mods or so we can't put all our modules in one string but we can have two strings of let's say one string of nine and then on the other entity we've got also one string off of nine modules now you'll notice that there's a little green arrow next to the mpp tracker if you click on it it will show you the minimum maximum voltages you can see it's nicely within the inverters range open circuit voltage is lower than the maximum voltage of 600 watt current is is lower etc you'll also see that there's a yellow check mark next to the inverter itself now the yellow check mark tells us that the reason why it's yellow is the design factor is 128 so notice the inverter is a little bit undersized for the tv modules but it's still within a tolerance range so it's normally except acceptable most inverters will allow up to another 50 factor so now it is all assigned each module to mpp tracker um if you don't like the way that is arranged there we can also go to the left here and arrange it horizontally so that your modules sits in that each it's a row well we represent one mpp tracker right the next step is first of all you'll see you'll notice that each module has a unique number that number shows you the inverter number mppt number the string number and the module number the next step is the cable plan for cable plan um here you can see how the string is organized so let's say we want to go into the roof somewhere and then i'm going to enter the grommet there i'm going to put a grommet let's say we're going to go into the roof there that's where we enter the roof you know i can right click on this string and i say cable this string to cable comment one and i can do the same with the second string capability to cable wrong with one and it will arrange it like this you can also move it a little bit let's say we want to make it meter like that the nice thing about this is that it will tell you how much cable you need but remember this is only going to be up to where you enter the roof so what you can also do is on the grommet if you right click on a grommet and we edit it you can tell it how far is this grommet from the inverter so let's say this grommet is 12 meters from the inverter um if we now click on the cable list it will add to 12 meters to the strings and you'll see that you need 31 meter positive cable and 48 meter negative if you go back to the terrain view you can view our um our roof from different angles we can move it around a little bit we can move it get over it view um and maybe easier etc etc right so let's move on to the next section [Music] you exit the 3d design you'll notice that it will ask you if you want if this data should be adopted into pv saw if you say no you will lose all your information if you say cancel you'll go back to video design so if you want to go out and you want to save your information you enter click on yes it will ask you to determine shading so let's say yes okay there and it will do a shading analysis period of hole yeah for you right next tip is cables so first of all when you open it you can enter your cable losses in detail or a total so i'm going to go for detail on the top you'll see that it will show you the string layout of your building a single line diagram first string second string into the inverter going to your load so normally what we want to do we want to add a couple of things so we want to feed into the grid so i'm going to add a 15 meter i'm going to click on that there so it shows me a 15 meter then i also want to specify my cable length from the meter to the inverter so let's say that is a 12 meter cable and if i click on a little calculator it tells me four millimeter square cable that i need then i want to add some symbols after inverter i want to add a isolator after inverter so click on add assembly and it will open a list of symbols i want to add in isolator or low brexit i also want to add a circuit breaker okay so now you can see this isolator of the inverter and a circuit breaker and pv saw will size the circuit breaker according to the cable thickness and distance then if you go to the dc side mpp tracker 1 let's say there we wanna first of all specify the length from the string cable from the models to the inverter and back so in this case i'm gonna let's say it's gonna be 25 meters if you click on that little calculator it tells me i need a two and a half millimeter square cable you can also override it to a bigger size and then to the right it will tell you the loss in your cable 0.35 loss which is not too bad also i want to add an isolator into my string so there i'm going to add the isolator and i want to add some search prediction so let's see where this is prediction so there you can see is my isolator and search protection i can also do it for the second string by just clicking on this arrow apply for all mpp trackers and then i've got it on all my trackers so in total we can see that if you saw will will specify the losses for us cable losses 0.35 percent and loss of inverters on the real quite inside 0.79 all of this at standard test conditions right so the next step is to go to my plan section where it shows you the single line diagram you can export it to different formats you can also look at the overview plan of your roof you can look at the detailed dimensions string plan of the system and parts list the next section we're going to look at is the financial parameters and first of all we're going to look at the economic parameters so if i click on edit it will open up a little box first step there is to enter the assessment period period over which time you're going to assess your system in this case it's like 20 years the annual average return on capital employed this is a figure that you normally get from a company and that's basically a threshold where the investment might become viable for them for instance if the company can get five percent interest on their money that they've got available but your system only return three percent then it's better for them to keep their money in a bank and not install the system but if your system can return ten percent it's better than the five percent that they can get in the bank and the investment might become viable so in this case um i'm going to enter a value of five percent there then income and expenditure is where you specify the cost of the system outgoing cost maintenance cost etc annually and subsidies where it's applicable so in this case i'm going to select a non-tax deductible cost because it's a private house it was a company it would be most probably tax deductible cost of the system in rand in this case we're going to save ten thousand kilowatt peak or 000 in total i'm gonna allow four thousand rand outgoing annual operation cost and um there's no subsidies and so forth i also allow for a five percent inflation on my annual operation cost going to the next step is specify a loan so in this case i'm not going to specify a loan but this all allows you to specify up to three different loans each loan can have a different payback period and a different interest rate etc then finally we can select if we want to allow for tax or not normally a company can appreciate the system in the first year under certain conditions so a company you would say allow for tax within a tax rate put in a depreciation period of one year a private individual unfortunately cannot do that so in this case i'm not going to allow for tax then we need to specify the type of system so the options there are surplus heating systems or net metering surplus feet in is where any excess pv will be fed back into the grit or throttle back and then net metering is only applicable where the municipality allows you to offset any power that you feed into the grid from power that you buy from the grit so in the case of a surplus fitting system you need to enter two tariffs the one is a feet in tariff so i've i've just selected the cape town feeding tariff as an example cape town feeding tariff if you look at the tariffs it's about 84 cents a kilowatt hour that they pay you to feed power into the grid then you also have a from grit tariff now from grid tariff i also selected the city of caicon sac tariff and um if i open it up you can see it's a block tariff from 0 to 600 at a certain rate to rent 11 and then it goes up to 291 and there's also a 260 range a month fixed cost tariffs can be customized and you can add your own tariffs each municipality have a different structure a different video we will show you how to add tariffs to your system what you can also do is to specify inflation rate for for tariffs so in this case i've allowed five percent inflation on the in-fitting tariff and eight percent inflation on the front grid tariff so after we've entered all the tariffs we are basically ready to simulate our pv system to simulate the pv system we click on a little calculator icon and it will simulate the system and give you a summary screen so on the left there you get a financial analysis where you get a total rate of return of almost 40 which is pretty amazing revenue or savings about 17 000 per year an accrued gas flow of 373 000 rat not bad on an investment of 50 000 rat then ac side helmets energy per year generated 7 800 kilowatt hour per year generated specific annual yield 1 500 kilowatt hours per kilo peak it also gives you a couple of graphs that's interesting so let's look at the use of pv energy the orange part shows you how much pv is generated and the gray part tells you how much of it you use and the blue part is how much of your feedback into the grid this is per month then the coverage of consumption shows you off the consumption which is gray how much is covered by pv and how much is covered by grit so in this case we can see that our consumption coverage is not not too bad actually if you click on that simulation item on the left you'll get these graphs the first one is own power consumption 65 percent now words 65 percent of the pv power you use directly the rest will go to the grid and 73 percent solar fraction and virtual consumption is covered 73.6 by pv the level of self-sufficiency in our word 73.6 right there's a couple of different options on the left that you can also look at let's look at the energy flow graph this graph shows you what energy gets generated how much goes to your load how much goes to the grid and what's come from the grid then there's all these different graphs that we've already looked at you can also look at the system balance and this shows you all the losses in your system as a percentage and as actual value and yeah you can see that if there's areas where there's excessive losses you can maybe use this information to optimize your system then financial analysis is where all the financial data gets comes together so there's a summary 20 assessment period so your return on the system is a pretty good 39 percent your authoritation period 3.2 years after 3.2 years your system is paid off and your production cost is only 69 cents a kilowatt hour on your pv this is with a once off payment of fifty thousand rand an annual cost of a thousand ninety year yeah you can see the payment that you get from utility of the year in the first year the savings you can get the detail on on the tariffs etc cash flow is a 20 year or 21 year depends on the period you selected shows you your cash flow so the first year you've got the 50 000 that you pay for the system and you're still a negative and you can see here on a year four you're starting to get into positive territory so the crude case flow see after the third year you break even and then from there on you save quite a substantial amount of money and then lastly you get the development of energy cost so the blue line is what you would pay with not installing the system over the years and orange line is what you now will pay with your pv system over the years you can see the substantial amount of savings that you get over time then lastly is the presentation this is the report that you can either present to your customer or to a financial institution etc the presentation of the report is fully customizable so you can select what you want to be part of this presentation and what not so you can also export it as a word or a pdf document and give you a very nice professional report on your system you can specify if you want to include financial parameters or you can even add your data sheets to it etc so in the customer presentation if you click on further options you can see there's a whole host of systems options that you can either include or exclude from your report for your customer this then concludes the brief overview of using pvsol in a application to simulate the application some other videos will go into more detail on adding tariffs and then also on importing external images into pvsaw 3d system in this video we're going to look at one of the newer features of pv saw premium a lot of new inverters have a feature where any excess pv can be redirected to a specific load for instance a swimming pool pump or a aircon unit something like that so in pvsol how they make provision for that is under consumption if you look at the add consumption button if you click it open you'll see there's a option for surplus consumption now in the surplus consumption you can now define the type of consumption it's a constant load like in this case a pool pump which is a 7 over 50 watt pump so if you define this then at any time when there's excess pv higher than 750 watt that output will be switched on and the pump will be switched on at that time there's also an option for a dynamic load where there's a maximum power and a minimum power so typically that might be something like a fridge or something that that sometimes switch on the compressor and sometimes switch off the compressor so how this will play out in the simulation so let's let's go to the simulation and if i go to the diagram editor which is also quite a nice feature of pv solar is where you can draw time series of a lot of different parameters there's a whole list of parameters that one can can add so in this case i've added our consumption in red the surplus consumption is now we need surplus consumption in blue and i've also in green listed the pv energy let's get generated okay so looking at this graph and this is now for one week in january you can see pv is in general higher than the load and there you can see at that point where there's excess pv that surplus loaded switch on our pool pump shoots on and then when the pv now is not enough anymore the pump will actually switch off you can also see here on this day where the sun is maybe not as bright the pump shoots on for a short while and then there's not enough pv and it switches off again so it's not a guaranteed output but it's a good way to make use of excess consumption some units will allow you to redirect that to a geyser or a unit that can warm your water or preheat your water and so on so that you can make optimal use of your heavy energy and increase your self-consumption if we look at the simulation we can see that in this case our own power consumption is now 77.6 and the solar fraction is 76.7 if i remove that load and surplus load and do the simulation again we can have a look at see what the own consumption is now so now we can see that our own consumption is only 65 so by adding that that excess load we could increase our consumption by about 10 percent [Music] in this video we're going to look at tariffs how to add your own tariffs so let's add from grid tariff and there's different types of tariffs that one can add so the most simple tariff that one can add is a straightforward fixed price per kilowatt hour tabs so i'm going to select the new tariff country south africa the city i can specify let's say it is johannesburg in this supplier i can select city power if it's not already there you can add suppliers and i can call this tariff let's say song for fixed which right there right now on the right hand side i can actually specify the tariff uh in this case let's say we have prepared there two rounds 50 per kilowatt hour fixed price 250. you can also add a base price because sometimes suppliers will charge you a fixed price per month so let's say there's a price price of 150 a month and that is that's it so that tariff you can then add and it's available a bit more complex tariff i'm going to add a new one again it's a block data or inclined block so example of that would be a tariff where there's um for a certain block say up to a certain kilowatt hour you pay a price and then if you use more you normally pay a higher price and then there can also be a fixed price per month so let's add a block color so once again i'm going to select from [Music] okay so from zero kilowatt hours let's say we pay uh 240 and then i can add another line so again from 600 and one so it's basically zero to six and that will be two and fourteen and from six hundred and one upwards you might pay 351 and so you can add more blocks if if there are more blocks from your supplier you can also then add your fixed price there right so the more complex types of tariffs is where you've got time of use talents and i'll give you an example of the time of use that up and this is typical of some of the eskim tariffs where there's actually six different um turn-ups almost there's a low demand season which is basically the summer months and then the high demand season june to august now in in each season there's three tariffs there's a of three time periods of sunday time period a saturday time period and a weekday time here okay and each one of those time periods have different either peak stand-up or off-peak garage so you can see that it can become quite a complex situation so how do you handle that in pv for this i'm going to open a project that i've already done so [Music] let's go to that quickly and i'll show you how you implement statified that in easol all right so there i've got a city of 20 industrial 2021 tariff if i select it and edit it by double clicking on that line you can now see that here we defined six different tariff periods which would be high season big time high season standard time high season off pika and then low season thick low season staying at low season off the tariff period one for instance is 139 this would be low season peak then 121 of the cheaper is low season standard tariff and then 86 cents is low season of victory high season pick that up there are four it's four and seventy that's a very expensive terror and then high season standard is 180 and high season off because wonderland and three cents so those are the different tariffs that's applicable now you can at the bottom here we can now assign those tariffs for a different um either pick off equal standards so in this case we've defined three tariff periods which is peak standard and off-peak so a would be big b would be standard and c would be off-peak so under tariff a you can now define per hour per day of the year if it's either which one of those tariff periods are applied so if we look at uh january up to may which is our off low season time then up to five o'clock in the morning it's out of three which is our low season low season off picked up 86 then from six to eight it's a low season um actually six o'clock it's a low season standard time then from seven to nine is our low season peak time which is um at one which is 193 then from 10 to 5 it's again standard time big time again from 6 to 7 in the evening and so forth that's now for weekdays for saturdays you can see it's a bit different there's only two tariffs there's over off-peak or standard time and then for sundays it's just basically off-peak time right now for winter period june june to august there it's uh up to five o'clock is our ice season our peak season um off peak tariff which is the cheapest tariff for that period but then from six o'clock to nine o'clock is that a four if there are four is that four and seventy that's our high demand season peak tara and so forth so you can per hour per day of the year refine which data is applicable and then obviously pv soil when it simulates the system will base the savings on the time period and the tariff applicable [Music] in this video we're going to look at one of the more advanced features of pv sole in terms of getting a building into your your system to simulate from in this case we're going to actually use a map section and we're going to import a roof plan from externally so load from hard drive i'll click on that and from there i'm going to import a drawing of a roof and there's my roy okay so obviously pv saw would not have idea of the scale of this drawing so we need to tell people we saw what the scale is and therefore we can either if we know we can put in the pixels per meter and the orientation or we can go click on this gear and we can actually scale it in the resource now on this plan this is an overhead roof plan of a building you can see there are some dimensions and for instance there's a 49.47 meters which is the length of the perimeter of this stand now to scale this in tv sole you'll notice that there's a blue line on top there so i take that blue line and i overlay it on a over unknown distance and put the other point on the edge of that perimeter and we know that that distance is 49.47 so at the length of the line measured i put in 39.47 meters and then immediately it works out the pixels per meter 37 pixels per meter and i can click on okay so now the building is scaled and i can start working with it further the other thing that that one needs to notice though is that the orientation might not be depending on the image that you input it might not always be north on top in this case we can see that north is actually here on the bottom left hand side so i also need to orientate my drawing correctly for north because south is at the bottom of the top of the stage so i'll go to terrain view um go to overhead view click from from the top and then i'm going to then i'm going to edit this plan of mine and i put my orientation i think it's 295 degrees so that north is on top now the building the drawing is scaled and the drawing is orientated when north corresponds to the heavy saw north which is very important right still a flat 2d image so to make a 3d image from it we need to do a couple of things for that i'm going to go to object view and i need to define roof areas that i can extrude in a 3d way so the way to do that is there's a menu option there under object view which says sketch a 3d polygon so i'm going to draw polygons over specific roof areas and i'm not going to do the whole roof i'm just i'll do a few portions of it just to show you how it works so i click on that hole i get a little pencil and then i draw my polygon over the loop so i'm gonna do this triangle portion of the roof and you can actually zoom nicely in to get it nice and accurate and the more time you spend here obviously there it is going to be so after each polygon you need to click on the polygon again to take the pencil away so that is a polygon and you can see on the left hand side it's polygon one defined right let's do a few more click on polygon again do this area right so there's that portion of the roof i'll do one last one for now okay and there's that problem so i've got my three polygons now i can extrude it now to be able to do that you need to know a couple of things you need to know the slope of the roof and you need to know the height of the eaves the eaves is the lowest portion of the room so i'm going to extrude 3d object and i normally just select the arbitrary building that's my object give it high tide of the eaves and in this case it's 3 meters if i edit i can now define the slope now the slope this roof is 25 degrees and the reference edge here is h3 now h3 is the lowest lead so the reference is always the lowest the lowest inside where the roof slopes towards so that three meters the lowest portion of the roof is h3 which is fine then i can do this for a second polygon next to 3d object obj building my heart is three meters i edit it once again it is a 25 degree roof but my reference edge is h3 so i need to select s3 because it slopes through it so it's free [Music] right and then the last one is that one that i'm going to do the object over the building three meters and if i edit it 25 degrees and it slopes towards it's four [Music] all right so there i've got my three roof areas now i can also go and change the texture of that roof and the top surface i'm gonna say it's a towel roof make my top surface a towel roof right and then i can go back to terrain view and let's look at a north view of the building and you can look at a east view for instance or a west view in this case i think northwest you can see there's my through the whole building just to give you that song then to be able to use these buildings you can see if you order your mouse over it it highlights the roof so let's say we want to put pv models in that roof i can right click on it activate the room and then i can go to module coverage and add my modules onto this roof
