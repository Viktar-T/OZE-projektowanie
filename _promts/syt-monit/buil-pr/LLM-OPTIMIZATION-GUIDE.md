### 7. Expected Output
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Expected Output

After completing this prompt:

**[Category 1]:**
- [Output 1]

**[Category 2]:**
- [Output 3]
```

**Why**: Clearly defines success state for validation.

### 8. Success Criteria
```markdown
## ‚úì Success Criteria

- [ ] [Checkable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Checkable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Checkable criterion 3]
```

**Why**: Provides verifiable checklist for completion.

### 9. Troubleshooting
```markdown
## üîß Troubleshooting

**Problem: "[Error description]"**
- Solution: [Fix steps]
- Verify: [How to check]

**Problem: "[Another error]"**
- Solution 1: [First try]
- Solution 2: [Alternative]
```

**Why**: Prepares LLM to handle common issues proactively.

### 10. Learning Notes (Optional)
```markdown
## üéì Learning Notes

**[Concept Name]**
- [Explanation]
- [Why it matters]
```

**Why**: Provides educational context for understanding.

### 11. Next Steps
```markdown
## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

After successful completion, proceed to:
- **Prompt [XX]**: [Next prompt name]
- [What you'll do next]

**Status Check Before Proceeding:**
- ‚úÖ [Criterion 1]
- ‚úÖ [Criterion 2]
```

**Why**: Creates clear progression path and exit criteria.

### 12. Additional Resources
```markdown
## üìö Additional Resources
