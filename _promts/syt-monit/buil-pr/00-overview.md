# Building an Educational Course Website - Overview

## Purpose

This directory contains a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for creating an educational course website using Docusaurus. These prompts are designed to be used with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, or other AI assistants to help instructors and developers build high-quality course platforms.

## What You'll Build

A modern, static educational website featuring:
- Organized lecture materials with slides and presentations
- Interactive components (quizzes, exercises)
- Project documentation and assignments
- Resource libraries and literature lists
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility-compliant content
- Integrated diagrams and visualizations
- Search functionality
- Dark mode support

## Example Implementation

These prompts are based on a successful implementation for:
**"Systemy bezpieczeństwa i monitorowania instalacji OZE"**
- Course for 5th semester Renewable Energy students
- 20h lectures + 10h lab sessions
- Focus: 90% monitoring systems, 10% safety systems
- Topics: SCADA, IIoT, data analytics, edge AI, digital twins
- Real-world applications in PV, wind, biogas, BESS monitoring

7. **07-custom-components.md** - Build interactive React components
8. **08-styling-customization.md** - Apply custom CSS and theming
9. **09-testing-validation.md** - Test functionality and accessibility
10. **10-build-deployment.md** - Deploy to production
11. **11-cursor-rules-setup.md** - Configure AI assistant guidelines

## How to Use These Prompts

### Option 1: With AI Code Assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot)

1. Copy the entire content of a prompt file
2. Paste into your AI assistant
3. Follow the assistant's guidance and execute suggested commands
4. Review and test the changes
5. Move to the next prompt

### Option 2: With Chat AI (ChatGPT, Claude)

1. Start a conversation with the AI
2. Provide context: "I'm building an educational course website"
3. Copy and paste each prompt in sequence
4. Ask the AI to generate the necessary code/configuration
5. Copy the output into your project files
6. Test and verify before proceeding

### Option 3: Manual Implementation

1. Read through each prompt as a guide
2. Follow the instructions and examples
3. Implement the code and configurations manually
4. Use the checklists to verify completion
5. Refer to troubleshooting sections as needed

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- Basic command line usage
- Basic understanding of web development
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax
- (Optional) JavaScript/React basics for customization

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Modern web browser

### Recommended Tools
- Cursor AI or similar AI code assistant
- Git client
- Image editing software (GIMP, Photopea)
- Diagram tools (draw.io, Mermaid)

## Estimated Time

**Complete Implementation**: 20-40 hours

Breakdown by phase:
- Setup and Configuration: 2-3 hours
- Content Structure: 2-4 hours
- Lecture Content Creation: 10-20 hours (varies by course size)
- Visual Assets: 2-4 hours
- Customization: 2-4 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Deployment: 1-2 hours

## Customization Guide

### For Different Course Types

**Programming/Technical Course**:

- Add syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Include downloadable starter projects
- Add IDE setup guides

**Science/Engineering Course**:
- Focus on formulas and calculations
- Include scientific diagrams and charts
- Add simulation tools or embeds
- Provide lab exercise templates

**Business/Humanities Course**:
- Emphasize case studies and readings
- Include discussion prompts
- Add multimedia content (videos, podcasts)
- Provide writing assignment templates

**Language Course**:
- Include audio pronunciation guides
- Add interactive vocabulary quizzes
- Provide grammar reference sections
- Include conversation practice scenarios

### Adjusting for Different Student Levels

**Beginner Level**:
- More detailed explanations
- Step-by-step guidance
- Frequent review sections
- Abundant examples

**Intermediate Level**:
- Balanced theory and practice
- Challenge problems
- Project-based learning
- Peer collaboration features

**Advanced Level**:
- Research-oriented content
- Open-ended projects
- Industry connections

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 lectures, then expand
2. **Iterate**: Build, test, get feedback, improve
3. **Version Control**: Commit changes frequently to Git
4. **Test Early**: Check responsiveness and accessibility from the start
5. **Document**: Keep notes on custom configurations
6. **Backup**: Regularly push to remote repository
7. **Consistency**: Use the same format across all lectures
8. **Accessibility**: Always include alt text and semantic HTML

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Creating all content before testing
❌ Ignoring mobile responsiveness
❌ Skipping accessibility checks
❌ Not optimizing images
❌ Inconsistent naming conventions
❌ Missing backup strategy
❌ Unclear navigation structure
❌ Overcomplicating initial setup
